```
Ctrl+L: Clear the screen. This is similar to running the “clear” command.
Ctrl+S: Stop all output to the screen. This is particularly useful when running commands with a lot of long, verbose output, but you don’t want to stop the command itself with Ctrl+C.
Ctrl+Q: Resume output to the screen after stopping it with Ctrl+S.
